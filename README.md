Dear Aj,

In order to run our CHANOM website smoothly, We recommend you to follow these steps

1. Let's get started by opening "home.html". This is our home page. Here you will see a moving product banner carousel. 
Below the carousel, you should see the signature drinks section containing 5 items. 
You can click on "More Detail" button and it will redirect you to the "product detail" page.
** Note that there are 5 products, each of which are in the same design but different detail

2. On the lower part each product detail page, there are also other drinks recommendations which can direct you to another product detail page.

3. Now, let's play around with the navigation bar. You can start by going to the "login" page. Here you can play around and test our form validation system.
** Please note that the sign in system does not work yet, so when you click on the sign in button, you will still be at the login page

4. After you have finished playing around in the login page, let's go to the "search" page using the navigation bar. Here you will see a search box and 3 search criterias.
Below the search section is the area for search results which will show 5 items and should be able to direct you to the detail page of each item.

5. Now, let's access the "product management" page using the navigation bar. You can play around with the product adding form and check the form validation.
You will also see a table showing existing products. In this table you should also see buttons for modifying and removing a product.

6. Finally, access the "about us page" using the navigation bar. Here is the page containing information about our stores and team members. 
Here you should check whether the email function works or not.

Now you should be familiar with our website already. Feel free to observe any page in more detail. 

**BUG REPORT**
Though we tried to make our website as responsive as possible, our website is not fully compatible with Mobile-First yet. So, adjusting window size to be too narrow 
will make the website look weird!

Thank you
CHANOM team
